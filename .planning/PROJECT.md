# AG-VOTE — Project Vision

## What is AG-VOTE?

AG-VOTE is a **web application for managing general assembly votes** (assemblées générales). It provides a complete workflow from meeting creation to official results publication, including real-time voting, quorum management, attendance tracking, proxy delegation, and regulatory compliance (PV generation).

## Target Users

- **Administrators**: Configure the system, manage members, email templates, policies
- **Operators**: Run live meetings — manage agenda, launch votes, track attendance
- **Members**: Participate in votes, view results, access meeting documents
- **Auditors/Public**: View audit trails, official results, public-facing pages

## Core Value Proposition

A **self-hosted, open-source** alternative to commercial voting platforms for organizations that need:
- Legal compliance for official assembly votes (French regulatory context)
- Real-time participation with quorum tracking
- Complete audit trail and official report generation (PV/procès-verbal)
- Multi-tenant architecture for SaaS or hosted deployment

## Technical Identity

- **No-framework PHP + vanilla JS** — minimal dependencies, maximum control
- **Docker-first** deployment — single container with nginx + php-fpm
- **PWA-ready** — service worker, offline capability
- **Real-time** — SSE (Server-Sent Events) for live voting updates

## Current State

AG-VOTE is a **brownfield project** with a mature feature set:
- 38 PHP controllers, 30+ repositories, 18 services
- 20 custom Web Components, 29 page JS modules
- Full design system with dark/light theme support
- PHPUnit test suite (20+ test files)
- Recently completed UX/UI audit with P1/P2/P3 fixes applied
