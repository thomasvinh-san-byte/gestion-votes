# Phase 11 Plan 01: Vote Settings Wiring Summary

Wire three DEAD vote settings (`settVoteMode`, `settQuorumThreshold`, `settMajority`) into VoteEngine and QuorumEngine via fallback policy synthesis — changing a setting now changes the calculation result.

## What Was Done

### Task 1: QuorumEngine settQuorumThreshold fallback

`QuorumEngine::computeForMeeting()` previously returned `noPolicy()` when no explicit `quorum_policy_id` was set on the meeting. It now calls `resolveFallbackQuorumPolicy($tenantId)` first. That method reads `settQuorumThreshold` from `tenant_settings` and synthesizes an in-memory policy array with `threshold = pct / 100.0` and `denominator = eligible_members`. If the setting is absent or out of range, `null` is returned and `noPolicy()` is called as before.

Code path: `computeForMeeting() → resolveFallbackQuorumPolicy() → settingsRepo->get($tid, 'settQuorumThreshold')`

### Task 2: VoteEngine settMajority + settVoteMode fallback

`VoteEngine::computeMotionResult()` previously left `$votePolicy = null` when no explicit vote policy was linked to the motion or meeting. It now calls `resolveFallbackVotePolicy($tenantId)` after the existing policy-resolution block. That method reads `settMajority` and returns a synthetic policy with `base = expressed` and the appropriate threshold (0.5 for `simple`/`absolute`, 2/3 for `two_thirds`, 0.75 for `three_quarters`).

Additionally, `settVoteMode` is now read and used to override `motion.secret` in the result: `secret` → `true`, `public` → `false`. This override runs regardless of whether an explicit policy is set.

Code paths:
- `computeMotionResult() → resolveFallbackVotePolicy() → settingsRepo->get($tid, 'settMajority')`
- `computeMotionResult() → settingsRepo->get($tid, 'settVoteMode') → $motionSecret override`

## Tests

9 new PHPUnit tests across two new test files:

| File | Tests | What Is Proved |
|---|---|---|
| `QuorumEngineSettingsTest.php` | 4 | settQuorumThreshold 60 → threshold 0.60; 75 → threshold 0.75; no setting → noPolicy; explicit policy wins |
| `VoteEngineSettingsTest.php` | 6 | two_thirds → adopted; three_quarters → rejected; simple → 0.5; secret → motion.secret=true; public → motion.secret=false; explicit policy wins over majority setting |

All 136 tests (9 new + 127 pre-existing) pass in the combined run.

## Decisions Made

1. **Test builder update over lazy-loading**: Rather than adding lazy-loading complexity to avoid DB calls, the `buildEngine()` / `buildVoteEngine()` helpers in existing test files were updated to inject a mock `SettingsRepository` returning `null`. This is cleaner and keeps the existing tests green with no behavioral change.

2. **computeForMotion() not touched**: The plan explicitly prohibits adding settings fallback to `computeForMotion()` to avoid regressions in the existing motion-level policy fallback chain.

3. **settVoteMode unconditional override**: The motion `secret` flag is overridden from the setting regardless of whether an explicit vote policy is present, matching the plan specification.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.
